Bamboo Mobile Heath Data Visualization Team

Changes:
-Fixed the way the calendar heatmap updates. It now
updates in place instead of creating a new calendar
every time.

-Created a starting color scheme, still receiving
feedback and will continue to update as requested.
-Legend at the bottom of the calendar will tell
user what each color means when they hover the cursor
over it.

-Added line chart to give the user a look at the data
over time. This chart currently uses made up data
and is for demo purposes only. 

-Line chart is currently reading data in TSV format
but can be changed to accept JSON data format fairly easily.
This was done because of the time frame of the current project
and we did not have time to look through the data in JSON format
for duplicate lines with the same date.

-Changed the drop box of symptoms to buttons since there are only
four symptoms currently. We left the code for the drop box
in the HTML file so it can be switched over quickly if needed.

-Entire website should display properly in desktop browsers and
mobile browsers with the exception of the line chart. The line
chart will still display but it may be small on smartphone browsers.

Issues:
-Current format of data makes it hard to check if there are multiple
instances of data per date. Suggestion: Replace UNIX timestamps with
human readable dates, this will also make it easy to check for multiple
instances of data per date.

-Entire project is coded in javascript and while not many people force
javascript from running, this could potentially be a problem that needs
to be addressed in the HTML.
