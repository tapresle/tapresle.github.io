        <br/>
        <p>Outside of typical development work, I have pushed for additional unit testing and automated documentation of any code written to keep code quality high and provide supporting developers with adequate documentation to make their jobs easier. Additionally, I have led numerous discussions around various pieces of our platforms to my team and other teams within my working group. I continue to support the Leap program as an alumnus by participating in panels and mentoring new alumni through their mentorship program.</p>

          <h2>Motiv8me iOS - Swift 4</h2>
          <br/>
          <p>My first learning experience with Swift that I started a couple years ago, I picked it back up recently, finished, and deployed the Motiv8me app to the Apple App Store. This app has similar functionality to the web app a little further down in my projects list which displays a set of images and quotes on a timed cycle.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>You can find the app on the app store <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motiv8me/id1447784871">here</a> and the source code <a href="https://github.com/tapresle/Motiv8meiOS">here</a>.</p>

          <p>I created a multi-user whiteboard webapp that allows users to collaborate on a drawable HTML Canvas. The user has the ability to join different "rooms", use different colors, and save the whiteboard as an image.

          <p>Lately I've had a bit of a creative streak and wanted to create some new web designs that are totally different than my day to day work. This has so far led to a few different blog post designs. I've open sourced these designs which are covered under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</a>.

          <br/>
          <p>My first foray into using Canvas for anything invovled, I created a 5x5 "pixel" avatar generator. This will randomly create a vertically mirrored image with the ability to save the generated image for personal use.

          </a>
          <p>As a summer project I started Motiv8me based on a question my fianc&eacute;e asked me. "Is there a website that brings together great photography and motivational quotes to brighten someone's day?" At the time I was also learning more about web developement and really wanted to give myself a challenge. Motiv8me was created using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, PHP, and Bootstrap. Currently the website allows users to view a randomly picked photo and quote that are on an automatic cycle every ten seconds. Users can toggle the cycle by clicking a link and can also manually go to the next randomly picked photo and quote. Users can also use a "Contribute" link to upload their own photos or quotes.</p>

          <p>I have also open sourced this project and the Github repo can be found <a href="https://www.github.com/tapresle/motiv8me">here.</a></p>

          <p>I have developed a few Pebble Watchfaces to get into the development of wearable devices. The four apps I have made so far have over 400 downloads total. Unfortunately the links to these apps don't work anymore since Pebble was bought by Fitbit and subsequently shut down, but I did gather a lot of experience with embedded systems and working under resource constraints.</p>
