My Personal Website

I created this website when I started learning web technologies and had an initial goal to get it working wiht Github Pages.
After the initial version of this website, I spent some time diving further into Bootstrap and based my new design on a template, but created my design by looking at the template.

This is just a place for me to have a web prescense and keep a portfolio of my work.
